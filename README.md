# Hi, I'm Kevin

I do many things, including:

- Developing revolutionary neural networks with Python and TensorFlow like [Convoluta](https://github.com/convoluta/convoluta.github.io) (to be released soon) 🙂
- Creating awesome JavaScript libraries with the latest web technologies like [boreDOM](https://github.com/HereIsKevin/boreDOM) 😎
- Developing interesting (but still boring) games in Python like [GeoBounce from Boredom Games](https://github.com/boredomgames/GeoBounce) 😂
- Designing minimal and intuitive CSS frameworks like [minimal.css](https://github.com/HereIsKevin/minimal.css) 🤔
- Creating powerful but lightweight prompts for bash like [neat](https://github.com/HereIsKevin/neat) 🤪

I have many other projects that I am experimenting with, tinkering with, and playing with. Currently, my main project is Convoluta. If you find any of my projects inspiring, revolutionary, or interesting, please give them a ⭐️ so I know they are appreciated.

If you want to contact me, please open an issue over [here](https://github.com/HereIsKevin/HereIsKevin).
