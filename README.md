# Hi, I'm Kevin

I'm a aspiring developer, student, and future CEO (hopefully). Currently, my main project is [Convoluta](https://convoluta.github.io), a revolutionary AI-powered solution to **stop misinformation before it even spreads**. My side projects are Blaze, a simple, safe, and intuitive programming with blazing-fast performance written in Rust and Fluid (soon to be released), a simple, blazing-fast **1.5 KB** UI library **without virtual DOM**.

I'm a Sublime Text fanatic (and whiz), Python zealot, and Rust devotee. I also enjoy using Go and TypeScript for Web Development, with Go for the backend and TypeScript for the frontend (duh). I dislike using Objective-C due to the unwieldiness of Apple's APIs, but I find myself using it more often than I would like.

I have many other projects that I am experimenting with, tinkering with, and playing with. If you find any of my projects inspiring, revolutionary, or interesting, please give them a ⭐️ so I know they are appreciated.

If you want to contact me, please open an issue over [here](https://github.com/HereIsKevin/HereIsKevin/discussions).
