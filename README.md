# Hi, I'm Kevin

I do many things, including:

- Designing revolutionary MMO games with bare-metal Go (previously Node.js) for performance like dotzz.io (to be released soon) 🙂
- Creating awesome JavaScript libraries with the latest technologies like [boreDOM](https://github.com/HereIsKevin/boreDOM) 😎
- Designing simple yet intuitive apps in Python with PySide2 like [Weather](https://github.com/HereIsKevin/weather_app) 🌤
- Developing interesting (but still boring) games in Python like [GeoBounce from Boredom Games](https://github.com/boredomgames/GeoBounce) 😂
- Designing minimal and intuitive CSS frameworks like [minimal.css](https://github.com/HereIsKevin/minimal.css) 🤔
- Creating powerful but lightweight prompts for bash like [neat](https://github.com/HereIsKevin/neat) 🤪

I have many more projects, nearly all of which I am going to open source when they are ready. Currently, my main project is dotzz.io and boreDOM. If you find any of my projects inspiring, revolutionary, or interesting, please give them a ⭐️ so I know they are appreciated.

If you want to contact me, please open an issue over [here](https://github.com/HereIsKevin/HereIsKevin).
